# Pytest configuration moved to pyproject.toml
# This section kept for backward compatibility only

# NOTE: All other configuration is now in pyproject.toml:
# - Project metadata (name, description, authors, etc.)
# - Dependencies and optional dependencies
# - Build system configuration
# - Version management (dynamic from __init__.py)
# - Entry points and scripts
# - Tool configurations (black, isort, mypy, etc.)
